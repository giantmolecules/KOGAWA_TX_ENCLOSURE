# KOGAWA_TX_ENCLOSURE

Here are the design files for an enclosure for the Tetsuo Kogawa FM radio transmitter. The "fancy" version is a bit more steampunky. Use with brass scews and thumbnuts (in the PDFs). The plain version can use plain steel screws and wingnuts. 

The PCB is different from the traditional 3" square FR-4 (fiberglass). Probably best to use FR-1 (phenolic) so it can be safely cut on an othermill or similar cnc. Will easily fit on the 4"x5" circuit blanks sold by SAIC resale.
